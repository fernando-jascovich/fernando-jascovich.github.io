      <description>I built my first mechanical keyboard, a MiniDox.
  Motivation  It was easy? nope. I already had experience doing something similar? nope. I had even held a solder for one second before? nope. I knew somthing about keyboards before (besides using one, of course)? nope.  So&amp;hellip; why? Well, to be completely honest, for fun mainly. I got my first comments about something called &amp;ldquo;mechanical keyboard&amp;rdquo; thanks to geekymartian, he built an ErgoDox and then others (two MiniDoxs and counting).</description>
